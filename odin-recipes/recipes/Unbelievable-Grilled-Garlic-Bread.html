                    <h2>Description:</h2>
                    <p>
                        French bread (or Italian) is lightly toasted, spread with a creamy cheese
                        mixture and grilled until warm, melted, and unbelievably delicious. The
                        finished bread keeps well in an airtight container.

                <ul class="list-div">
                    <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
                    <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
                    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                    <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon half-and-half</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
                    <li>1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, halved lengthwise</li>
                </ul><br>

                    <h2>Steps:</h2>
                    <ol class="list-div">
                        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat.</li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, mix the mayonnaise, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. In a
                            saucepan over medium-low heat, mix the Cheddar cheese, half-and-half, and
                            paprika. Stir constantly until melted and smooth. Pour into the bowl with
                            mayonnaise mixture, stirring until well blended.
                        </li>
                        <li>Place the French bread on the grill cut side down, and let it toast for a few
                            minutes. Remove from the grill, and spread the cheese mixture on each side.
                            Place the halves back together, and wrap the loaf in aluminum foil. Return to
                            the grill for about 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the loaf is heated
                            through and the cheese mixture is hot.
