        <ul>
            <li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, peeled and minced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon half-and-half</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, halved lengthwise</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat grill for medium heat.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix the mayonnaise, garlic, and Parmesan cheese. In a<br>
                saucepan over medium-low heat, mix the Cheddar cheese, half-and-half, and<br>
                paprika. Stir constantly until melted and smooth. Pour into the bowl with<br>
                mayonnaise mixture, stirring until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>Place the French bread on the grill cut side down, and let it toast for a few<br>
                minutes. Remove from the grill, and spread the cheese mixture on each side.<br>
                Place the halves back together, and wrap the loaf in aluminum foil. Return to<br>
                the grill for about 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the loaf is heated<br>
                through and the cheese mixture is hot.
