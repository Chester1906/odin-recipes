        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) bottle Italian-style salad dressing</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Steps: </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk salad dressing, garlic powder, and salt together in a shallow baking<br>
                dish; add chicken breasts and turn to coat. Cover the dish with plastic wrap<br>
                and marinate in the refrigerator, 4 hours to overnight.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess; discard remaining<br>
                marinade.
            </li>
            <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and the<br>
                juices run clear, about 7 to 8 minutes on each side. An instant-read<br>
                thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74<br>
                degrees C).
            </li>
        </ol>
